# Luis Romero - Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is a modern, responsive, and interactive portfolio built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The website showcases my professional experience, projects, skills, and provides a way to get in touch.

The website also features the UI of my AI-powered RAG chatbot that answers questions about my professional background, skills, and experience. More about that project in the [personal-rag](https://github.com/luiseduromp/personal-rag) repository.
